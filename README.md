Analyzing Fitness Trackers Reviews 

Fitness trackers are the latest in digital tools and gadgets that monitor your progress to help you attain your health and fitness goals. Whether you are trying to lose weight, develop your muscle strength, or training for a sports competition, you need a fitness tracker to get your body where it needs to be.
One of the simplest measures that almost all fitness trackers monitor is daily steps. Just like a simple pedometer the tracker will count how many steps you take every day. A general guideline for maintaining healthy behavior is 10000 steps per day.
If you set a goal such as increasing your steps by 1000 per day, you will immediately get feedback on that goal and whether you achieved it. This can motivate you to build on progress and increase your movement and exercise.
In this project I would like to collect all the reviews and review scores and then do the price comparison and then sentimental analysis. I would like to know the best price for the  fitness trackers and analyze the reviews and review score.
Steps of Project :
First step is to scrape the data from the - https://www.amazon.com/pcr/Top-Rated-Fitness-Trackers-Reviews/5393958011
